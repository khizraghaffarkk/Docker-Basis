# Docker Project

## Project Overview

This is a Docker-based project that performs specific tasks with Python and includes necessary certificates, data, and configurations.

## Files and Structure

- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in version control.
- **Dockerfile**: Contains instructions to build the Docker image.
- **ca.crt**: Certificate Authority file for secure communication.
- **feeder.py**: Python script that processes the data (likely from `toyota_data.csv`).
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **server.crt**: SSL certificate for server security.
- **server.key**: Private key for server security.
- **toyota_data.csv**: Sample dataset used by the `feeder.py` script.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.
- Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/khizraghaffarkk/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-docker-project .
    ```

3. Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 my-docker-project
